Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code following book Effective TypesScript's instruction and principles.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

Book Effective TypesScript principles:

1. **Explain how TypeScript relates to JavaScript and why understanding JavaScript is crucial for mastering TypeScript.**
2. **Give reasons to avoid using the `any` type in TypeScript and provide safer alternatives.**
3. **Explain why type annotations (e.g., `:number`) are preferred over type assertions (e.g., `as number`) in TypeScript.**
4. **Describe the importance of using more specific types in TypeScript, and provide examples of using literal types (e.g., `'left' | 'right'` instead of `string`).**
5. **Explain the concept of types as sets in TypeScript, and discuss how union (`|`) and intersection (`&`) types work.**
6. **Why should we avoid creating overly complex union types, and what are the consequences of doing so in terms of readability and flexibility?**
7. **What are extra property checks in TypeScript object types, and how can these checks be bypassed when necessary?**
8. **Discuss the difference between `any` and `unknown` in TypeScript, and explain why `unknown` is the safer choice when working with uncertain types.**
9. **Provide reasons to prefer using interfaces over type aliases for object types in TypeScript, and explain when type aliases might be a better choice.**
10. **Explain the benefits of using `readonly` in TypeScript to prevent accidental modification of data, and show how to apply it to objects or arrays.**
11. **Describe how to use utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Pick` in TypeScript, and explain how they help avoid redundant code.**
12. **Why should you prefer interface extension (`extends`) over repeating fields in TypeScript, and how does this reduce redundancy?**
13. **Demonstrate how `keyof` and mapped types can be used to dynamically create types, reducing the need for repetitive type definitions.**
14. **Discuss the potential pitfalls of using enums (`enum`) in TypeScript, and suggest alternative approaches such as using union types or constants.**
15. **Explain the purpose of the `strictNullChecks` option in TypeScript and how enabling it leads to better handling of `null` and `undefined`.**
16. **How can you distinguish between synchronous return types (e.g., `T`) and asynchronous return types (e.g., `Promise<T>`), and why is it important to make this distinction in TypeScript?**

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

React Best Practices

- Use functional components with prop-types for type checking.
- Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
- Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
- Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
- Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
- Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
- Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
- Use useMemo for expensive computations.
- Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
- Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
- Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
- Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

State Management

- Use Zustand for global state management.
- Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
- Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component foundations.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use Tailwind for utility classes and rapid prototyping.

Performance Optimization(Next.js Features)

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement route-based code splitting in Next.js.

Forms and Validation

- Use controlled components for form inputs.
- Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
- Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
- Use Zod or Joi for schema validation.

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions.

Accessibility (a11y)

- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Implement proper ARIA attributes.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support.

Testing(when needed)

- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows.
- Use snapshot testing judiciously.

Security

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML sparingly and only with sanitized content.

Internationalization (i18n)

- Use libraries like next-intl for internationalization.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
